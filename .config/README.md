# MY DOTFILES !!

These are just my own personal dotfiles. Feel free to take a look or download them for yourself, but they are pretty messy and not fully functional yet.

Message me on Discord (@sapphortnite) if you have any questions or general words of wisdom.

## -- What's in each file --

I will eventually make a proper wiki, but until then... everything goes in the README! Also yeah totally not finished.

### quickshell

Quickshell configuration. 

#### --Assets

Contains images and such used in Quickshell.

#### --ExtraFiles

Files I'm not using anymore but didn't want to delete. Feel free to ignore.

#### --Info

Files for accessing system info. SystemStats.qml does most of the work, then the other files are used to get icons, labels, and such. Theoretically, SystemStats.qml should only be used by other Info files. Everything else should be using specific Info files.

### hypr

Hyprland configuration. Nothing special.

### kitty

Kitty terminal configuration. Nothing special.

### yazi

Yazi file manager configuration. Nothing special.
